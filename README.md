### Learning in Public!
Self-studying an Accelerated Introduction to CS (course and assignments from brown university).       source @ https://learnaifromscratch.github.io/
Getting back into programming after a long, regretted pause ... since first learning about it in high school.

All the assignments are in a language called Pyret.
Might do them again in other languages for practice.


files can be run at code.pyret.org
