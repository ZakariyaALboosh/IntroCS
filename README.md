### Learning in Public!
Self-studying Brown Uni's Accelerated Introduction to CS.       source @ functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/
Getting back into programming after a long, regretted pause.
It's December 1st. planning on going "full throttle" on this course for a week. 

#### Will post a daily summary of insights here.
---------------------------------------------------------
## Day 1   dec 1st:
did the lab on binary trees  tree-traversal.arr
wasn't challenging. I think I found a mistake in the OP's (original poster) implementation of in-order tree traversal.
Did this not under any time pressure in over an hour including breaks :).

## Day2 dec 2nd:
todo: 1 - start cursor assignment. watch some lectures. do streams lab.
